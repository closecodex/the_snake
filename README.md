# üêç Snake Game

## Description

**"Snake Game"** is a classic arcade game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

The player controls a snake that moves across the game field, eating apples and growing in length. The goal is to grow the snake as long as possible while avoiding collisions with its own body.
